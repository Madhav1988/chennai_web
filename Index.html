    <h1>Chennai</h1>
    <div id="chennai-para">
    <p>Chennai, formerly known as Madras, is the capital and largest city of Tamil Nadu, located on the Coromandel Coast along the Bay of Bengal. As one of India’s most significant urban centers, Chennai stands out for its rich history, diverse culture, and rapid economic growth. With a population that makes it the sixth-most-populous city in India, Chennai also forms the fourth-largest urban agglomeration in the country.

The city’s origins trace back to the 17th century, when the British East India Company established a trading post and built Fort St. George, marking the beginning of modern Chennai. Over the centuries, it evolved from a colonial port town into a vibrant metropolis, serving as the capital for various administrative regions under both British and independent Indian rule. In 1996, the city officially adopted the name Chennai, reflecting its Tamil heritage.

Chennai is renowned as the “Gateway to South India” and is a major hub for culture, commerce, and education. Its economy is diverse, with strengths in automobile manufacturing, information technology, healthcare, and electronics. The city is often called the “Detroit of India” due to its large concentration of automobile industries and is a leading center for software exports, second only to Bangalore. Major IT parks and global companies have established a significant presence, making Chennai a magnet for skilled professionals and expatriates
